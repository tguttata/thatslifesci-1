**That’s Life [Science]** is a free source of articles spanning the realm of the life sciences. It was created by an interdisciplinary collective of graduate students who strive to provide readily accessible information about the life sciences to the general public. We examine life at many levels, from molecules to entire ecosystems and consider the evolutionary history, behavior, physiology, and ecology of life. If you need your daily fix of animal pictures and videos, find some new favorites in [Earth's Organisms]({{ site.url }}/categories/Earth's%20Organisms/) and [Our Ecosystems]({{ site.url }}/categories/Our%20Ecosystems). If you're curious about a new disease or odd animal behavior, we'll show you [How It Works]({{ site.url }}/categories/How%20It%20Works/). Come with us to our labs and field sites in [Grad School Diaries]({{ site.url }}/categories/Grad%20School%20Diaries/) to see what day-to-day life is like as a scientist. Join us as we explore life through the lens of science!  

We’d like to thank our faculty advisor Dr. Patricia Brennan for her guidance, as well as our funding source, the UMass Amherst Graduate Student Senate.
