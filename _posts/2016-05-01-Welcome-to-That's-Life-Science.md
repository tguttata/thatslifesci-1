All we knew is that we wanted to make an outreach blog. We weren't sure how or who would be willing to help with such an endeavor. A core group of organizers lay the groundwork for what the blog might look like and began to recruit from several life science graduate programs across the University of Massachusetts Amherst campus. We recruited 30 students from six different graduate programs: Environmental Conservation, Microbiology, Molecular and Cellular Biology, Neuroscience and Behavior, Plant Biology, and Organismal and Evolutionary Ecology. Through the process of planning and building this website, we have been able to meet and collaborate with people across departments and study areas. When working with a group of people who believe in a cause and are excited about what they’re doing, everything becomes so much easier. Within months, we have created something we can be proud of and are excited to share with all of you. Our goal is to bring accessible life science articles to the general public, while creating a new thriving community of early career scientists who are actively practicing science communication. We hope to continue growing and improving to bring our work to people internationally as well as in the local community. 

We hope you will join us in welcoming That's Life [Science] to the web universe. Keep your eye on us in the time to come!

That's Life [Science] Team
