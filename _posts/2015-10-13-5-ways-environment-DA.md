teaser: "There’s no question that human activities impact the natural environment. Some times human activities have devastating consequences on the environment, while some human activities have the sole purpose of improving or restoring the environment. Unfortunately, the latter occasionally has a negative result, despite having positive intentions."

Humans negatively impact the environment in many ways: pollutants from industrial plants dumped into waterway, cutting down entire sections of forest, and prolific burning of fossil fuels resulting in global climate change are just a few examples. In the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly of human impacts on the environment, these things would certainly fall into the “Ugly”. However, there are times when humans have good intentions, but our attempts to help the environment actually hurt it. Here are a couple examples of times when human attempts to improve the environment back fired.


1) **Forest fire prevention** – The US Forest Service was founded in 1905 with one of its main goals being to prevent and extinguish forest fires. To that end, it did a great job. The frequency of forest fires in the US has decreased since the 1970’s. However, while the number of fires that happen each year has decreased, the amount of land burned each year has increased. How can this be? By preventing and quickly extinguishing forest fires through the second half of the 20th century, we inadvertently created more densely wooded forests with more dead trees and dry leaves and pine needles. All those extra trees, branches, and leaves means there’s a lot more fuel for fires allowing fires that do start to burn hotter and grow larger than fires used to. The Forest Service is aware of this problem and knows how to fix it. Unfortunately, Congress prefers to provide the Forest Service with emergency funds for fighting fires rather than the smaller amount of money they could spend to prevent mega fires in the first place (Figure 2)([Click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX1xnWPSjKg) to watch a great video by MinuteEarth explaining this problem [3mins])

2) **Osborne Tire Reef**  - In the 1970’s, over 2 million old tires were sunk to the sea floor off the coast of Fort Lauderdale, Florida to create an artificial reef. Seem like a dumb idea already? Well, on the surface of it, the plan wasn’t that bad. Many sea creatures like mussels, barnacles, and tube worms need solid structure to attach to. These organisms can help build the base of a food web to feed larger organisms like fish. Not to mention, many fish like having structure to hide in or around. You may be thinking that the tires would leach chemicals into the water, but that actually wasn’t the problem. The problem was the tires were tethered together and anchored to the bottom with steel clips attached to concrete blocks. The clips corroded allowing the tires to break free, eventually smashing into natural reefs during storms. Oops.

3) **Feeding wild animals** – They’re so cute, you just can’t help but be generous and give them a bit of your food. But feeding wild animals is never a good idea, for several reasons.  For starters, “people food” could be bad for them. Ducks and geese fed white bread, crackers, popcorn, and the like have been linked to a wing defect called angel wing (Figure 4). Feeding wild animals also reduces their natural fear of humans which can increase the likelihood of vehicle-animal collisions when the animals spend more time near humans trying to get food.

4) **Nature Clean-Ups** – Beach clean-ups that pick up human litter like plastic, metal containers, etc. are a good thing. However, there are times when volunteers attempt to clean up a habitat by removing some natural materials that the volunteers do not realize are important for the ecosystem. For example, removing leaf litter from stream bottoms or thorn bushes growing along a river bank is bad for the riverine ecosystem. Bacteria decompose that leaf litter, insects eat those bacteria, and fish eat those insects. That leaf litter is actually an essential part of the river ecosystem’s food web. Likewise, the plants growing along a river bank filter out pollutants from reaching the water while providing shelter for other organisms like birds. Just because these bushes are unsightly and a nuisance to humans doesn’t mean the rest of Mother Nature sees it that way.

5) **Biocontrol agents gone wrong** – Invasive species are organisms that are either intentionally or unknowingly introduced into a region that they are not naturally found. Without any natural predators or competitors in the new region to restrict them, invasive species can flourish, wreaking havoc on the ecosystem. Humans then try to find ways to control the damages that the explosion of the invasive species can cause. The obvious solution is to introduce the natural predator of the invasive species to control their populations. Unfortunately, this doesn’t always work out so well. The most famous example in ecological text books is the introduction of the cane toad into Australia to combat the cane beetle that was devastating the sugar cane crop. This failed miserably as the toads were unable to eat many of the beetles. They did, however, thrive by feeding on other insect species and harmed potential predators of the toad with toxins they could emit from their skin. Generally speaking, vertebrates are a bad choice for biological control agents because they usually do not specialize on a specific target species. Therefore, they will impact other aspects of the ecosystem.

This isn’t to say that we should stop trying to help the environment. Even within the categories presented above, there are many cases where human attempts to clean up natural systems, or create artificial reefs, or control and invasive species have been successful. However, it is very important that we learn from our mistakes in this realm. The key is to remove our human biases as much as possible when determining what is good or bad for the natural world. This is challenging to do, but it is essential that reality take precedence over human desires, opinions, or emotions.
